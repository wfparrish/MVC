Completed most of Tania Rascia MVC app.

Start with local storage portion of the tutorial


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this project, 

1. Add calls to Google that query the todo item entered by the user. 

For instance, if the user typed "plant a tree" we will return the 
Google Search for "plant a tree". The goal would be to see if any 
relevant information is returned to the user, that might further aid
their goal implementation

2. Make the response stylish. Create cards using Bootstrap

The "gimmick" or "twist" I would like to implement is to make this about
the combination of Google search and API calls, not the Todo list.
I just want to show how a simple todo list could be brought into the future
That I have the ability to modify a simple idea

3. Write Jasmine tests
4. Automate the app using Selenium
5. Use MongoDB Atlas (and test async/await calls with Jasmine)

The reason this tutorial is SO good is because she doesn't use folders to demonstrate
MVC. The concept of MVC is neatly OOP'd and defined in ONE file, todo.js. 

This makes you realize MVC is just a 'concept' and the developer may implement
this idea any way they like. Folders are just a natural way to display the 
use of MVC to yourself and other programmers. Using files also makes the programmer 
think about M, V, and C as seperate areas of concern.
