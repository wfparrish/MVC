Completed most of Tania Rascia MVC app.

Start with local storage portion of the tutorial


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this project, 

1. Add calls to Google that query the todo item entered by the user. 

For instance, if the user typed "plant a tree" we will return the 
Google Search for "plant a tree". The goal would be to see if any 
relevant information is returned to the user, that might further aid
their goal implementation

2. Make the response stylish. Create cards using Bootstrap

The "gimmick" or "twist" I would like to implement is to make this about
the combination of Google search and API calls, not the Todo list.
I just want to show how a simple todo list could be brought into the future
That I have the ability to modify a simple idea

4. Automate the app using Selenium
